# Mapping-Occupancy-Dynamics

This project uses machine learning techniques to infer data
collected from “simple” sensors placed strategically in rooms
within an apartment such that they have the best field of vision of
the rooms to automatically recognize human presence. Existing
sensor networks and infrastructures that are used for mapping
room occupancy employ models based on security systems.
However these systems can be very intrusive and comes at a
privacy, computational, and monetary cost and hence are not
really suitable for the regular home. With this project we examine
the use of PIR sensors primarily and capacitive bed sensor as a
second cross validation sensor to show that such sensors are
enough to tell us which rooms are occupied and which rooms are
not.
