# Mapping-Occupancy-Dynamics

This project uses machine learning techniques to infer data

collected from “simple” sensors placed strategically in rooms

within an apartment such that they have the best field of vision of

the rooms to automatically recognize human presence. Existing

sensor networks and infrastructures that are used for mapping

room occupancy employ models based on security systems.

However these systems can be very intrusive and comes at a

privacy, computational, and monetary cost and hence are not

really suitable for the regular home. With this project we examine

the use of PIR sensors primarily and capacitive bed sensor as a

second cross validation sensor to show that such sensors are

enough to tell us which rooms are occupied and which rooms are

not.
